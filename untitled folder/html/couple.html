                What is the advice for each money style as couples?
            </p>
            <p class="explain">
                Opposites, as the saying goes, tend to attract. This has not been empirically shown to be the case in terms of Money Styles, but if we take this as true, then it is particularly important to explore how couples on opposite ends of the Money Style chart can become successful money teams. 
 
                There are no hard and fast rules to how to successfully merge/ complement Money Styles. However, you and your partner can choose to UNCAP. We have provided some general guidance (in 5 not-so-simple steps) based on our experience with couples across various life-stages and contexts.

                      <span>Understand: </span>Seek to understand your natural attitudes towards money and those of your partner. Understanding the roots of your partners behaviours and attitudes will probably help you become less judgmental. If you have not taken it yet, this <a href="https://vested.ng/quiz"></a>5min Money Persona Quiz</a> will help you and your partner understand how you both relate with money, why and what to do about it.

What sacrifices might be required from each partner, given their natural Money Persona? Some give-and-take is required in this process.

                      <span>Communicate: </span>The conversations about our money goals, attitudes and concerns are the crucial starting point. These conversations should start early in the relationship (once things get serious), should be honest and, should continue as the relationship evolves. If you are already having these conversations, you are already ahead of the game. If you are now inspired to have your first one, it is not too late! You can start today.

Accept each otherâ€™s humanity and celebrate the fact that you will occasionally fall short of the ambition you set for yourselves and each other. You might break your 3-year-long Hoarder streak with an occasional jewelry splurge, but it is OK.
